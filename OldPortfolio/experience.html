              <p><em>January 2022 - November 2022</em>
                <br><small>As the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown regulations loosened, together with close friends I
                  organized two events at renown Rotterdam clubs. Given my love for music and ambition for it, I
                  believed that there was a market gap to be filled in the nightclub scene of the city with a focus on a
                  quality house music experience. For this initiative, I had to utilize and further develop my
                  communication, DJing, content-creation and stakeholder management skills. Having successfully sold out
                  both events, I learned the key factors for a successful event project management while also
                  discovering personal improvement points for further endeavors.

              <p><em>September 2020 - June 2021</em>
                <br><small>Working for ETConsulting gave me an opportunity to do tech-consulting for a Rotterdam-based
                  startup specialized in tendering software, delivering a market segmentation and marketing strategy.
                  Having worked for such a company opened my eyes into the difficult first steps of starting a business
                  in tech while simultaneously trying to sell an innovative product.</small>

              <p><em>March 2019 - August 2019</em>
                <br><small>I decided to start working in Construction Management at my family-run business. This taught
                  me the exact construction process of mixed residential and commercial properties, while also learning
                  how to deal with problems as they arise. Most importantly I saw the value of good stakeholder
                  management, timely risk management and people skills in strategic investment choices for achieving
                  project success.</small>

              <h6>Line Engineer| Lamex Foods Europe – SRB</h6>
              <p><em>June 2018 - August 2018</em>
                <br><small>This position gave me the opportunity to learn the basic principles of how a berry-processing
                  line works and is supposed to be maintained. I worked as a member of a four-person group and served as
                  an assistant in fixing the machines when necessary. In the case that a part of the line would stop
                  even for several minutes, several hundreds of kilograms of fruit would be processed and packed later.
                  Preventing longer delays meant there had to be a team of line technicians present the whole day in
                  order to quickly fix issues when they occurred. Next to this, I consulted the company on renewable
                  energy choices given their high energy consumption for freezing up to 8.000 tons of fruit.</small>
