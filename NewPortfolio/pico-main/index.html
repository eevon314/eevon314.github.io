                    <br><small>As the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown regulations loosened, together with close friends I
                      organized two events at renown Rotterdam clubs. Given my love for music and ambition for it, I
                      believed that there was a market gap to be filled in the nightclub scene of the city with a focus on a
                      quality house music experience. For this initiative, I had to utilize and further develop my
                      communication, DJing, content-creation and stakeholder management skills. Having successfully sold out
                      both events, I learned the key factors for a successful event project management while also
                      discovering personal improvement points for further endeavors.

                      startup specialized in tendering software, delivering a market segmentation and marketing strategy.
                      Having worked for such a company opened my eyes into the difficult first steps of starting a business

                      how to deal with problems as they arise. Most importantly I saw the value of good stakeholder
                      management, timely risk management and people skills in strategic investment choices for achieving
                      project success.</small>

                    <br><small>This position gave me the opportunity to learn the basic principles of how a berry-processing
                      line works and is supposed to be maintained. I worked as a member of a four-person group and served as
                      an assistant in fixing the machines when necessary. In the case that a part of the line would stop
                      even for several minutes, several hundreds of kilograms of fruit would be processed and packed later.
                      Preventing longer delays meant there had to be a team of line technicians present the whole day in
                      order to quickly fix issues when they occurred. Next to this, I consulted the company on renewable
                      energy choices given their high energy consumption for freezing up to 8.000 tons of fruit.</small>
